//! Long-running KERIA operations.
//!
//! KERIA answers a request that cannot complete immediately — resolving an OOBI, waiting for
//! witness receipts, waiting for a delegator's approval — with an *operation*: a named handle whose
//! state a client polls. The schema spells each of the fourteen operation families as three
//! interchangeable objects, `Pending…`, `Completed…`, and `Failed…`, distinguished by a `done`
//! constant and by whether a `response` or an `error` is present: forty-two types describing one
//! shape.
//!
//! Here that shape is [`Operation<M, R>`], whose [`OperationOutcome`] makes the three states a
//! `match`. The fourteen families are type aliases fixing the metadata and response types.
//!
//! # Why there is no single decodable `Operation`
//!
//! The schema also declares a union of all fourteen families, and upstream types both
//! `Operations.get` and `Operations.list` as returning it. That union has no runtime discriminant:
//! four families share `{pre, sn}` metadata and several share a response shape, and TypeScript
//! never checks — every response body reaches application code through an unchecked
//! `await res.json()` cast, so the declared type is a claim about what the caller asked for, not
//! something the document proves.
//!
//! Rust cannot honestly reproduce that as one decodable type, so it does what upstream's callers
//! effectively do: the caller names the family. [`UntypedOperation`] decodes the envelope with the
//! metadata and response left as JSON for a caller that does not yet know, and
//! [`UntypedOperation::into_typed`] narrows it once it does.
